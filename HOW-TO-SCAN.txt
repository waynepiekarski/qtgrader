Set up scanner with the following settings:

PDF
Medium Quality
300 DPI
Black and White
Printed Picture
Darkness set to maximum right
Background removal at default

Each unique exam type should be processed separate from other batches

Cut off top left corner with guillotine

Break up papers into sets of students so they fit into the scanner feeder

Scan rotated 180 so that the chopped corner is facing away from the scanner

After batch is done, flip over and scan with chopped corner away again

Repeat for each set of papers.

You will end up with a set of PDFs:

Scan1-SideA Scan1-SideB Scan2-SideA Scan2-SideB É etc

The merging tool will handle the merging and rotation to generate a set of images in consecutive order.
