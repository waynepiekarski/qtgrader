The tool has been very stable and there are no known bugs at this time.

Some features that I would like to see included are:

- Integration with online teaching tools
It would be nice to be able to upload the grades directly into online
course systems without having to type them in manually. This would
require documentation from the course system provider to be able to
implement this.

- Integration with email to students
It would be nice to be able to automatically send the generated PDF files
to the students, either via email, or via their online course system. This
would require a list of email addresses for the students, or documentation
from the course system provider to send the emails.

- Integration with database system
Currently all the scanned images and grades are stored in the local filesystem.
It would be interesting to see everything stored in a central repository so
that grading could be done by multiple humans at the same time.

- More integrated scanning process
Currently the scanning is done manually using the provided shell scripts. Having
the scanning directly integrated into the application would help to streamline
this process and make it a bit easier.

Currently I am not doing further work on the tool at this time, but would be
interested in getting feedback from others who find it useful.
